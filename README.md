**First Milestone Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute**

## Introduction
Welcome to my first Milestone project. The following demonstration of my capabilities concerning this site is to help showcase my ongoing progress as a coder and a brief glimpse into the typical styles I would adhere to based on my current skillset and experience. 
At this juncture my intended audience are for prospective Employers, Recruiters and Collaborators within Front End Web development. Now at the early stages of my developemnt, I realise that I have limited show of live projects so I have included some links to pesuedo-sites or lessions that I have learned along the way 
to help you get a better understanding of where I am coming from! So the point is that I am ever evolving as a web developer, this position will inevitably change in due course as my skillset and experience increases over time.

[View the live project here.](https://benjamin144.github.io/My-Resume/.)

This is the main marketing website for Code Institute. It is designed to be responsibe and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for potential students and partners.

## User Experience (UX)

### Strategy
Moving on I've designed and built this website to deliberately focus on standard navigation across entire site to promote a simple look and feel with a 'pop' of colour here and there. 

### Scope
The pages allow the intended user to focus on the market strategy for presenting information briefly as they don't have to choose to scroll through endless body text. 
They might just see that I can trust this guy to get my projects out the door in a dependable fashion.

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. As an Employer       ||  I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the individuals experience plus by accessing recent projects they might have and also to be able to see a CV to form an impression of the persons character.
        2. As a Recruiter       ||  I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to share information with my peers, and to find content like a downloadable CV or some ind of demonstration of talent.  
        3. As a Collaborator    ||  I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their followings on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. As an Employer       ||  I want to drill deeper and source their problem solving capabilities.
        2. As a Recruiter       ||  I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.
        3. As a Collaborator    ||  I see what kind of improvements could be made everywhere, my past projects may be revitalized they can get access to my git repos for more learning.

    -   #### Frequent User Goals
        1. As an Employer       ||  I want to check to see if your evolving and if you're interested in how to inprove things for others
        2. As a Recruiter       ||  I want to check to see if there are any new blog posts.
        3. As a Collaborator    ||  I would like inspiration and an openess to different ways of looking at the world and would engage on that basis

### Structure
I want to make the website  that is easily understood or done so; presenting no difficulty. The visual communication is quick and to the point, collaborators can pause at any point and be lead by the sites journey, and if they don't have too much time on their hands, 
then they can easily jump to the end where they aren't overburdened by too much call to action, it's about the simplicity of information presented. The site flows simultaneousley across four pages
So I preferred to use .col-3 at most points throughout the site because I found it was nice to work with avoiding scaling issues and flexible enough for mobile responsiveness.
I used centered text and visual aids to navigate the user through their experience when using the site. From another aspect I tried to use the imagery 
to evokes my interest in architecture, industrial design and the arts through the ages and the enviromnment around us provides which help provide a visual landscape. 
The logo has been created by myself. My navigational elements are `fixed` and visual links ease in and out on the top of the viewport throughout. There is an optional modal on the about.html page that reveals more detaiked information
Each page is srollable, providing 'eye comfort' and revealing a large but modest footer providing access to my personal details. This information is consistent through each page.

### Skeleton

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   I have used primary colours accross the sight the heading colours are Blue and the secondary colours are Orange, Green & Purple.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Mitr & Roboto fonts are the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. 
            I used Mitr as it is a sans serif styled font and it has a friendly feel iwhich I wanted to bring out in the site design layout, whilst Roboto is known for being an easy to read font and rythmic 
            according to 'Google Fonts both are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall texture in programming so I deemed them appropriate to use on this website.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   I have selected imagery to evoke a sense of spatial distribution within a given environment. The large, background images are architectual in nature and is designed to give a visual impact where 
            the image colour schemes contrast or compliment the navigational elements and components on the website.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the person.

        1. Upon entering the site, users are met with a solid deep bl ue navigation bar to go to explore a choice of three other pages. Beneath the nav bar the user is impacted by a dynamic full width background image that bears my full animated name and 
           job title. The user can click simultaneously switch between arrow and job title once clicked on scrolls down to the lower extremities of the page.  
        2. Once there the user will quickly understand the purpose of the website which really is pre marketing a call to action, considering me as a potential employee, candidate or collaborator.
        3. The user is free to scroll back up or back down the page to the footer, to see the details on how to stay in touch with me or choose to delve deeper into the website if still interested. With a handy 'back to the top' feature to save excessive scrolling.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

        1. The site has been designed to aid the user in making simple traditional choices when navigating around the site and the use of catchy imagery has been chosen to maintain interest, throughout their journey.
           Each nav bar item is featured to keep the user engaged as much as possible with delayed hover/time effect. The logo in the top right hand corner is non desript and it's purpose is to lead the user to the homepage when on other pages of the site.
        2. In keeping with the home page style of presentation, I have kept the style very basic and honest with alot of white-space with symbolism. The idea behind this is to help the user push through the site as quickly as possible, only focussing in on what is necessary at the time of reading.
           I have therefore minimized my profile to a modal button where again the user can breifly access it or stay interested.
        3. When the user clicks on the Skills Page, they are met with more bold inviting images and quote to keep the user further engaged. Purpose being that it may help the user to focus on the content and information they were seeking. 
           The use of the carousel is to further confirm the skillset on offer by me as a Front end web developer and how I would rate myself.
        4. The user will be spending most of their time on this page, I have added a portfolio dropdown nav-item here so the user can see further examples of my learning of differing web development presentations.
           On the final Contact Page the user can easily scroll down to a section where they have an option to get in touch with me 
        

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their following on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.
        1. Once the new visitor has read the About Us and What We Do text, they will notice the Why We are Loved So Much section.
        2. The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.
        3. At the bottom of the Contact Us page, the user is told underneath the form, that alternatively they can contact the organisation on social media links below which highlights the links to them.

-   #### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the new programming challenges or hackathons.

        1. This is in development but links to blog sites on the 'Say Hello page was intended for this purpose.
        2. As the purpose of the site goals are not consistent at this early stage nevertheless will be introduced in the future.

    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.

        1. The navigation bar has an opportnity to contact me with a 'Call to action' as a Nav-item link to the Contact Page.
        2. The visitor can then  fill out a form on the page or are told that alternatively they can message the organisation on social media.
        3. The footer contains links to the organisations Facebook, Twitter Reddit, Google, YouTube and Pinterest page as well as the organization's email.
        4. Whichever link they click, it will be open up in a new tab to ensure the user can easily get back to the website.
        5. The personal information section is set up to autofill 

    3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the Facebook Group link so that I can join and interact with others in the community.

        1. The Facebook Page can be found at the footer of every page and will open a new tab for the user and more information can be found on the Facebook page.
        
-   #### Frequent User Goals

    1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added challenges or hackathons.

        1. The user can use search components in the navigation bar to look for challenges

    2. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new blog posts.

        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the blog link
